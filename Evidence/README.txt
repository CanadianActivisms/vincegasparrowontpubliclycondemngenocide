# IG-first dataset (v4)

Place `public/data/evidence.json` into your site so EvidenceExplorer can load it.

Folders:
- public/data/evidence.json — the JSON your site fetches
- evidence.csv — the same data in CSV form
- screenshots/ — placeholder files; replace with real screenshots
- archives/ — paste archive links inside each matching .txt

How to use:
1) Copy `public/data/evidence.json` into your project's `public/data/` folder.
2) (Optional) Fill `archived_url` in the JSON (or CSV → regenerate JSON) after using archive.today.
3) Replace placeholder screenshots with real captures (handle, timestamp, full caption).
